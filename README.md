# COVID-19-Regression-Analysis-in-US
Built ARIMA and Log-linear model with 95-97% accuracy to predict daily Confirmed, Active, recovered cases and Deaths is US. Conducted SIR Analysis and obtained a reproduction factor of 1.08 which ideally should be in between 1-2. 
Used JHU Data and did data cleaning and data preparation. Decided p, d and q where p is lag based on partial autocorrelation plot, d is order of differencing when time series is stationary and q is order of lag which is based on autocorrelation plot. For finding d used dickey-fuller test and selected d where p value is less than 0.001. 
For log linear model used tslm and log of variable and trend is added. In an SIR model, used Susceptible which means total population which can be infected, I is population infected and R is population recovered. There are differential equations for each S, I and R over time and in order to solve used desolver package in r. We get beta and gamma and ratio R0 is beta divided by gamma. R0 is average number of susceptible people who are infected by each infectious person.
